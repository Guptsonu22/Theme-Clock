Theme Clock ‚è∞

This is a dynamic and visually appealing Theme Clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project displays an analog clock with a modern design, alongside a digital clock and the current date. The design is simple yet elegant, with a focus on providing real-time updates.

Features:
Real-time Clock: Combines an analog and digital clock for time representation.
Current Date Display: Shows the day and date dynamically.
Minimalistic Design: Features a dark theme for an aesthetically pleasing appearance.
JavaScript Interactivity: Updates the clock hands and time in real-time using JavaScript.

How It Works:
